I am working through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) using Racket. More specifically, I am using the helpful [neil/sicp](http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/) PLaneT module, which is based on the R5RS subset of Racket. This repository is a place for me to keep all of the exercises as I work through them in a test-driven manner using [SchemeUnit](http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/schematics/schemeunit.plt/3/5/planet-docs/schemeunit/index.html).

# Installing dependencies

# Running a single chapter's tests

```

# Running all tests
